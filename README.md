Portfolio website

This repo contains my personal portfolio and bio.
Projects are added to the portfolio as they are completed and my bio is updated as I keep on thriving. 


There are three pages: 
index.html is the bio page
portfolio.html is my current list of projects
contact.html is a page where people can tell me how much they like me

contact.html is not yet functional, but will be soon

The website is made responsive using bootstrap and css.
